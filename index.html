		<h2><span style="color:blue">About</span></h2>
		<p>My name's Tatjana Nashadka. It is spelled correctly. It's
		just Polish. I am a bioinformatics major who is currently a 
		junior at BYU, hopefully. Though schoolwork takes up the 
		majority of my time, sometimes I like to procrastinate by 
		reading and listening to music, calmly enjoying the world 
		until it catches up to me again</p>
		<p>I have a small family consisting of a father who is currently
		in China avoiding his family, though he says it's for work, a
		mother who cannot stop painting if her life depended on it, and
		a sister who I love very much except when we have to fight over
		the car. There are also two idiots who like to freeload off of
		us, though most would consider them to be dogs.</p>
